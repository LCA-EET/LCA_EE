@0 = ~Love Conquers All (Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition)~
@1 = ~This mod is applicable only to Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition.~
@2 = ~Welcome all to the Hall of Wonders. A mere gold piece secures entry to the most curious collection priceless historical artifacts and machination inspirations on all Abeir-Toril. The craft displayed within is truly a sight to see, and the gold raised goes to needed supplies, that future wonders will be wrought.~
@3 = ~Good on you, friend. Come inside the Hall of Wonders, but please remember the 1 gold donation. It provides sponsorship for those that craft the curious wonders inspired by Gond, and for those that maintain and protect the priceless artifacts contained herein. This patronage supports the... not immediately salable works produced.~
@4 = ~I should be safe here. In the mean time, you have quite the task ahead of you. If I'm right, the Iron Throne is going to stage a coup. I fear that Nederlok, Corwin and the others won't return in time.  You're the only ones who'll be able to stop the coup.~ 
@5 = ~I am again in your debt. That creature has kept me helpless for too long. Perhaps if I hadn't been incapacitated, I might have been able to prevent Scar's death. *cough* Angelo will soon hear of my recovery. It is important that you take me away from here; I'm sure Angelo won't want me coherent and among the living. Take me to the Harbor Master's building â€” he is a good friend of mine. I can rest there, and send word to Nederlok and Corwin to return to the city immediately. They're loyalty is beyond reproach, and they can retake control of the Fist while I recover. Take this letter; I managed to filch it off Rashad when he was "caring" for me. From what I read of it, it seems that Sarevok has dire plans for the city. I fear for the lives of my fellow Dukes, Liia and Belt. If they were to die, Sarevok would take over the city. You must find Slythe and Krystin, and stop them... *cough* Hurry! We must make haste.~ 
@6 = ~Oh yeah, lots of stuff. You know about Duke Eltan, don't ya? He's been diseased. That's why Angelo's in charge now. It'd have been Scar, but he went out and got assassinated, and that Corwin bitch who arrested me's on some training exercise up north with Marshal Nederlok. Ya, the city's gone downhill over the last week. Too bad, heh heh.~
@7 = ~They still have leadership. How effective it is, I do not know. With Captain Corwin sent on some training exercise up north, I hear Angelo Dosan is now effectively in control. Such a weasel he is. I am surprised he has the support of the troops. He's got powerful friends though, and I hear that he takes orders straight from Sarevok. You've heard of him, right? With Entar dead, the other Dukes have called an emergency election. Sarevok is the front-runner, and his stand against Amn is very popular. Imagine how much pull he will have if he actually has the Flaming Fist in his back pocket.~
@8 = ~There's trouble in the Fist, <CHARNAME>, big trouble. Duke Eltan's fallen sick and Scar was killed, supposedly in a simple robbery but I have my doubts... It's all Angelo, he's making a power grab, taking control of the Fist and, with Scar gone and Corwin sent on some bogus errand up north, there's nothing to stop him! I've seen him paying visits to the Iron Throne, too, and I don't like it one bit... There are some of us that are still loyal to Eltan and, lucky for you, I happen to be one of them. Please, for your sake and ours, keep your head down and, if you get the chance, sniff around the Iron Throne's base. If you can find a way to talk to Duke Eltan, even better, but they're keeping him in the middle of Fist headquarters... Damn it, Angelo will pay dearly for this and I hope it's soon...~
@9 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. You efforts have not been in vain. My commanding officer, Captain Corwin, has ordered my contingent and I back to the city to make our reports. You will figure prominently in them and I assure you that our accounts will be favorable.~
@10 = ~Ammo Belt~
@11 = ~This shoulder belt is ideally suited for holding sling bullets, darts, arrows, or bolts.

STATISTICS:

Weight: 2~
@12 = ~Officers' Training Manual
@13 = ~This appears to be a Flaming Fist officers' training manual. It includes policies and procedures covering incident investigations, suspect apprehension techniques, proper etiquette when dealing with city officials, and much more. The initials "S.C." are written on the inside cover. It's clear that "S.C", whoever they are, has spent a great many hours studying the manual intently; it is well-worn, and some of the pages are coming loose from the binding.~
@14 = ~LCA Assistant~
@15 = ~LCA Assistant

This assistant allows you to configure certain characteristics of the Love Conquers All (LCA) mod.~
@16 = ~Burned Document~ 
@17 = ~This document has been burned, but parts of it are still legible. From what you can make out, the recipient was ordered to head to a staging area north of the city, due to a spate of assassinations. They were to wait there and prepare to retake... something. You can't make it out. Who it was addressed to you cannot say, though you see what you think is a Flaming Fist insignia on the lower right corner of the page. Interesting.~
@18 = ~LCA Debugger~
